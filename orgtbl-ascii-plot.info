Orgtbl Ascii Plot rebooted and re-styled!

   Once an independent package, Orgtbl Ascii Plot was incorporated into
Emacs Org Mode long ago.  This revisited release brings instantaneous
Unicode box‑drawing bar-plots right into Org Mode tables.

   The new release keeps the original simple design:
   • zero dependencies on external packages,
   • no PNG, GIF, SVG, PDF, or any image format, just pure text,
   • no setup (see *note Key binding C-c " a and menu entries::),
   • drop-in replacement which preserves the legacy bar-plots (see *note
     Wizard::).

   The new bar-plots make sense of your data (see *note Gallery::):
   • Unicode characters instead of ASCII ones render a polished aspect,
   • vertical grid lines enhance readability,
   • non-numeric cells are handled seamlessly, so mixed data-sets won’t
     break your plots (see *note Robustness::),
   • much care has been taken on fine details.

   Small changes:
   • ability to display the coordinates of the vertical grids (see *note
     Display grid coordinates::),
   • empty data cells and cells containing the minimum value used to be
     plotted as ‘◦’ (a small zero); they are now rendered as ‘▏’ (a
     vertical grid) (see *note Robustness::),
   • Org Mode formatted dates supported (see *note Dates::).

3 First example
***************

We have a column with numerical values:
     |  1.74 |
     |  5.54 |
     |  5.50 |
     |  4.57 |
     |  7.18 |
     |  6.51 |
     |  7.39 |
     |  9.57 |
     | 12.58 |
     | 13.57 |
     | 13.79 |
     | 12.10 |
     | 15.72 |
     | 17.26 |

   Orgtbl Ascii Plot adds a column to visualize it:



     |  1.74 | █▏    ▏      |
     |  5.54 | ███▋  ▏      |

   It is a bar-plot drawn with the so called "block characters" of the
UNICODE standard.  There is a vertical line at ‘x=10’ to help make sense
of the data.

   To get this result, just do that:
   • put the cursor in the data column,
   • type ‘C-c " a’,
   • answer ‘1-vertical’ for the style of plot (completion available,
     just type ‘1 TAB RET’),
   • accept the suggested 12 characters width, minimum, and maximum by
     hitting ‘RET’ three times,
   • define the vertical grid line to be at the ‘x=10’ coordinate.

   This took about 15 seconds.

4 How does that work?
*********************

It works by adding a new column with a spreadsheet formula:



     $2='(orgtbl-ascii-plot-with-vert $1 0 18 12  6)

   A wizard is available to insert this spreadsheet formula.  Invoke it
with ‘C-c " a’, while the cursor is inside the column to plot.

   Here we requested vertical lines 5 units apart from each other (the
first one being at the far left side of the plot).

   We requested the plot to map values in the range ‘[0…17.26]’ and
stretch over ‘12’ characters.  Actually, the range was automatically
adjusted to ‘[0…20]’ so that the vertical lines fall at the beginning of
characters: ‘y=0’, ‘y=3’, ‘y=6’, ‘y=9’.

   Basically, the process is as follows:
   • put the cursor in the data column,
   • type ‘C-c " a’,
   • answer ‘many-verticals’ for the style of plot (completion
     available, just type ‘m TAB RET’),
   • accept the suggested 12 characters width, minimum, and maximum by
     hitting ‘RET’ three times,
   • define the vertical grid lines to be ‘5’ unit apart from each
     other.

6 Wizard
********

Writing down the correct Org Table spreadsheet formula is far from
obvious.  Therefore a wizard is available.

   Actually, there are 6 sub-wizards for 6 plotting styles, launched by
the top-level wizard.

   • ‘0-vertical-ascii-legacy’
   • ‘0-vertical-unicode-cont-legacy’
   • ‘0-vertical-unicode-grid-legacy’
   • ‘1-vertical’
   • ‘2-verticals’
   • ‘many-verticals’

   The first one, ‘0-vertical-ascii-legacy’ is the legacy plotter.  It
uses only usual ASCII characters.  Therefore it is guarantied to work
anywhere where a mono-spaced font is available.

   The 2nd and 3th, ‘0-vertical-unicode-xxxx-legacy’, are also legacy
plotters.  They were not accessible through a key binding or a menu.
Now they are.  They make use of UNICODE block characters, as the 4th,
5th, and 6th styles.  Therefore, they need a character font able to
display them (see *note Fonts::), and the file must be encoded in a
variant of UNICODE, for instance UTF-8 or UTF-16.

   The ‘1-vertical’ style adds a vertical grid line at a specified
coordinate.  It may slightly increase the maximum so as the grid line is
at the beginning of a character.

   The ‘2-verticals’ style is like the ‘1-vertical’ with 2 grid lines.
It may adjust the specified minimum and maximum to get the 2 lines on
the beginning of a character.

   The ‘many-verticals’ style adds as many lines as needed so as there
is a specified spacing between one line and the next.  The left border
of the plot is considered to be the first vertical grid line.  The
specified minimum and maximum may be adjusted so that the grid lines
fall on the beginning of characters.  It may also increase the specified
width in characters.

7 Key binding ‘C-c " a’ and menu entries
****************************************

The wizard is bound to the following keyboard sequence: ‘C-c " a’.  This
happens to be the standard Org Mode key-binding.  But no worries!  The
function that ‘C-c " a’ used to call is still available unchanged.  Just
answer ‘0-vertical-ascii-legacy’ (completion available) to the wizard
when it asks for the style of plot.

   The top-level wizard and the 6 sub-wizards can also be launched from
the menu.  Follow:

   ‘Menu > Table > Plot’

   By the way, the legacy Unicode plots (‘orgtbl-uc-draw-cont’ and
‘orgtbl-uc-draw-grid’) are not directly available in Org Mode.  With
this package, they are.  Just select ‘0-vertical-unicode-cont-legacy’ or
‘0-vertical-unicode-grid-legacy’ (completion available) when the wizard
asks.

   3 new styles of plots are added by this package: 1, 2, and many
vertical lines.  Each has its own sub-wizard.


File: orgtbl-ascii-plot.info,  Node: Asking for minimum and maximum,  Next: Dates,  Prev: Key binding C-c " a and menu entries,  Up: Top

8 Asking for minimum and maximum
********************************

All sub-wizards ask for the minimum and maximum values to plot.  Just
type ‘RET’ for the default value.  The defaults are the current minimum
& maximum found in the table.

   If you intend to add rows to the table later on, you may want to
enlarge the ‘[min..max]’ interval beforehand.  This is why the wizard
offers to enter different values than the actual min & max.

   The wizard also offers to adjust the minimum and maximum to the
closest human readable value.  For instance, when the actual minimum is
‘23.45’, it suggests the value ‘20’.  To choose the suggested rounded
value, type ‘<down>’ (this is the downward arrow key).

   If a value to plot falls outside the chosen ‘[min..max]’ interval, no
worries.  It will be plotted anyway with a visual hint that it is out of
bounds.  See *note Robustness::.

9 Dates
*******

Org Mode dates are supported in data columns.

   Each date is first converted to the number of seconds since
‘[1970-01-01]’.

   This is the convention followed by Org Mode (see
‘org-time-string-to-seconds’ for reference).  Note that there might be
an offset if the daylight saving time is set.

   Example:



     | [2028-04-27 12:02] | ▏     ▏      |

10 Refreshing
*************

In case the table evolves, there is no need to run again the wizard.
Just type:

   ‘C-u C-c *’

   This will redraw the plots (as well as update all other spreadsheet
formulas).

   To refresh a single row, type:

   ‘C-c *’

   If the table has changed too much, delete the column containing the
plot with ‘M-S-<left>’, and re-create it.


File: orgtbl-ascii-plot.info,  Node: Unicode constraint,  Next: Fonts,  Prev: Refreshing,  Up: Top

11 Unicode constraint
*********************

Unicode imposes a constraint: the vertical grid lines are only drawable
on the left pixels of a Unicode character.  (This constraint could be
partially lifted with other Unicode characters, but they are not well
supported by usual fonts).

   Therefore the wizards perform complex calculations to convert user
specified coordinates (positions of vertical grid lines, and minimum and
maximum values) into usable Unicode characters.  This may involve
lowering the minimum, growing the maximum, or even increasing the
specified width in characters.

   Here is a summary of what each sub-wizard must do to comply with the
Unicode constraints:

sub-wizard                       minimum     maximum     width
---------------------------------------------------------------------
0-vertical-ascii-legacy          untouched   untouched   untouched
0-vertical-unicode-cont-legacy   untouched   untouched   untouched
0-vertical-unicode-grid-legacy   untouched   untouched   untouched
1-vertical                       untouched   INCREASE    untouched
2-verticals                      DECREASE    INCREASE    untouched
many-verticals                   DECREASE    INCREASE    INCREASE

   The other constraint, of course, is that the Org Mode file must be
saved in a UNICODE encoding.  For example, it may be UTF-8 or UTF-16.
One among many ways to achieve that is to add the following line at the
top of the Org Mode file:

     # -*- coding:utf-8; -*-

   Or you may check what is the preferred character encoding by
executing this command:

     M-: (coding-system-priority-list t)

   If the answer is ‘utf-8’ or ‘utf-16’ or another variant of ‘utf’,
then chances are that your Org Mode file will be correctly encoded.

12 Fonts
********

Not all fonts can display the needed Unicode characters:

   ‘▏▎▍▌▋▊▉█←→◦’

   You may want to use the following recommended fonts.  They are
mono-spaced, they support those Unicodes, and they are open-source.

   • DejaVu Sans Mono
   • Unifont
   • Hack
   • JetBrains Mono
   • Cascadia Mono
   • Agave
   • JuliaMono
   • FreeMono
   • Iosevka Comfy Fixed
   • Iosevka Comfy Wide Fixed
   • Aporetic Sans Mono
   • Aporetic Serif Mono
   • Source Code Pro

   You may define a font available throughout Emacs with:

   ‘M-x customize-face default’

13 Robustness
*************

Non-numeric and out-of-bound cells in your input data are handled
nicely.  They won’t break the plot.

   • Non-numeric cells are just copied in the bar-plot, with vertical
     grid lines overwritten.
   • Out-of-bound cells are those numeric values which fall outside the
     specified ‘[min..max]’ interval.  A visual arrow points in the
     direction where the actual value lies.  You may request a new plot
     with an enlarged ‘[min..max]’ interval.

   Fine, but those are character coordinates.  We are interested in
coordinates relative to our data.

   To translate character coordinates to data coordinates,
   • add a temporary row in your table with ‘S-M-<down>’,
   • type ‘?’ (a question mark) in the data column,
   • refresh the row with ‘C-c *’,
   • look at the plotted column.

   You should see something like the first row in this example:




                         ╭────────────────────────────────────────╮
               ╭─────────├────────────────────────╮               │
               │    ╭────┼────╮     ╭─────────────├─────╮         │
               ▼    ▼    ▼    ▼     ▼             │     │         │
     |   ? | (0.0 25.0 50.0 75.0 100.0) |         │     │         │

     #+TBLFM: $2='(orgtbl-ascii-plot-with-vert $1 0.0 100.0 12  3 6 9)


   It translates the character-coordinates to data-coordinates.  The
minimum & maximum you specified appear as the first & last coordinates.

   When done,
   • remove the temporary row with ‘S-M-<up>’ (if you want).

15 Installation
***************

If you catch the package from Melpa, add the following lines to your
‘.emacs’ file, and reload it.

     (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t)
     (package-initialize)

   Alternately you may customize this variable:

     M-x customize-variable package-archives

   Then browse the list of available packages and install
‘orgtbl-ascii-plot’
     M-x list-packages

   Then (lazy) load the package.  The most straightforward way is the
widely accepted ‘use-package’ facility.  Put that in your ‘.emacs’ file:

     (use-package orgtbl-ascii-plot
       ;; load the package only after Org Mode table has been loaded
       :after (org-table)
       ;; do not load the package until it is used
       :defer t
       ;; redefine the [C-c " a] key binding and add menu entries
       :init (orgtbl-ascii-plot-bindings))

   Alternately, you can download the Lisp file, and load it:

     (load-file "orgtbl-ascii-plot.el")
